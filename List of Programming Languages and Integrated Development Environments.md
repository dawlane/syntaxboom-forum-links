# List of Programming Languages and Integrated Development Environments

This is going to be the start of a list of useful links to various programming languages and Integrated Development Environments. If anyone adds some gems, then they will be added to this post, so people don't have to go through every post.

**NOTE:** Many of these sites linked here, have not been fully checked or validated for what contents they offer, and possibly in the future they may also be broken. Anyone using the links should remain vigilant to protect themselves from malicious software and sites through the use of internet security software and good judgement by not falling prey to sites that require the specific entry of personal information. The accuracy of the descriptions may also not be correct, and should be in many cases considered a work-in-progress.
If they don't appear to be what is advertised, or look suspicious.
Then PM an administrator so they can be removed, or updated with the correct information.  
**So use these links and any associated software from these sites at your own risk!**
